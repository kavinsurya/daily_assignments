                    <br> One of the most successful cricketers of the IPL, Dhoni would once again go into the tournament as one of its biggest (if not the biggest) attractions.

                    <br> MS Dhoni has smashed 209 sixes in IPL so far, most by an Indian batsman and 3rd overall behind Chris Gayle (326) and AB de Villiers (212). Dhoni’s nearest competitor is Mumbai Indians captain Rohit Sharma and Suresh Raina. Both
                    of them have hit 194 sixes in the IPL. RCB captain Virat Kohli is at No.6 on the list with 190 sixes.

                <p> The 13th edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) is set to kick off on Saturday with defending champions Mumbai Indians taking on Chennai Super Kings. For once, it looked like the board might not be able to stage the league. But it
                    kept all options open and shifted the tournament to UAE.
                    <br> IPL 2020 will mark the comeback of Indian cricketers back to the field after six months. The Virat Kohli-led side had last played against New Zealand earlier this year. The ODI series against South Africa was cancelled after the
                    first washed-out game. Following IPL 2020, the national players will fly to Australia for a full-fledged series.

                        <p>During this year’s U.S. Open, professional tennis player Naomi Osaka wore seven different face masks for each round of the annual tournament. Each mask, which she started wearing when the tournament began on Aug. 31, named a Black
                            person whose death has been repeatedly cited in nationwide protests about racial injustice. After winning the U.S. Open’s singles tournament on Saturday, Osaka said the masks were her way of using her platform to protest this
                            injustice and advocate that Black lives matter. Asked by a reporter after the tournament what message she wanted to send, Osaka responded: “Well, what was the message that you got was more the question. I feel like the point
                            is to make people start talking.” The seven masks Osaka wore in recent weeks included the names of Breonna Taylor, Elijah McClain, Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, George Floyd, Philando Castle and Tamir Rice, all names that
                            have come up repeatedly as victims of racial injustice. Raising awareness—even on social media—will hopefully lead to more people talking about them, Osaka said.

                    tour amid coronavirus concerns. "It was a good feeling going out there," said 34-year-old Nadal. "Not beautiful, the feeling playing without the spectators, because the energy of the fans is impossible to describe. "But for me, at
                    least, today was a very positive comeback. "I played a very solid match and very serious and doing a lot of things very well, so very happy."
