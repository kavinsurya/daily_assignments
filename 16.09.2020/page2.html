                        States that slash spending to make it through an economic crisis can end up worsening income inequality — the gap separating incomes of top and bottom earners — for years, finds new research in State Politics & Policy Quarterly.
                        <br><br> Americans today are dealing with a sudden and deep recession brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. With tens of millions of jobs gone or waylaid since the U.S. economy shut down in March, and anticipated tax revenues
                        dried up, state leaders face tough budget decisions. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine in May announced spending cuts of $775 million, with the biggest chunks coming from education and Medicaid. DeWine has said he won’t raise taxes. Meanwhile,
                        California has borrowed almost $350 billion from the federal government for unemployment insurance and also plans to cut education spending. U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in April suggested states should file for
                        bankruptcy, but that would take a change in federal law, which does not allow states to go bankrupt.

                    Many people in the United States face unexpected medical expenses despite having private insurance coverage, due to a phenomenon known as “surprise billing.”
                    <br><br> Surprise bills occur when people with private insurance get services that fall outside of their plans’ networks. Some of this out-of-network care is very difficult to avoid because it often results from emergency medical services.
                    <br><br> People who require emergency transport by an air ambulance, for example, are likely to find their insurers will balk at paying these costs, according to a 2019 report from Congress’ investigative arm, the Government Accountability
                    Office. GAO staff examined data for air ambulance transports of privately-insured patients in 2017. They found 69% of about 20,700 transports in their data set were out-of-network. An air ambulance company, for example, charged $41,400
                    for transport of a North Dakota consumer, whose insurance plan paid $6,700 of the cost, GAO said. This left the consumer with a potential bill of $34,700, although it’s possible that the air ambulance company later agreed to reduce
                    these costs, GAO said in its report.

                    Academic studies in recent decades have repeatedly shown that how the news media portray Latinos and other minority groups influences how the public feels about them and whether voters support policies designed to help them.
                    <br><br> Research also indicates media coverage can affect how individuals see themselves and their place in society.
                    <br><br> As journalists take on contentious national issues such as immigration, public education reform and neighborhood policing — issues that have a tremendous impact on Latinos, America’s largest minority group — it’s important
                    they understand how their coverage can impact local communities.
                    <br><br> Nearly one-fifth of people who live in the U.S. — 18.5% — identify as Latino or Hispanic, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Meanwhile, more than half of the nation’s foreign-born population is from Latin America, Census
                    Bureau estimates from 2018 show.

                <p>During the first half of 2020, schools across the U.S. closed to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus. In recent weeks, government officials in many parts of the country have either reopened schools for the fall semester or are debating
                    the possibility, even as epidemiologists and other researchers work to understand the role children play in transmission of COVID-19.
                    <br><br> To date, children account for a small fraction of reported COVID-19 cases in the U.S. — 9.3% in states that report their cases by age, according to an Aug. 20 report from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children’s
                    Hospital Association. But parents, teachers and others worry that reopening school campuses and resuming in-person classes will lead to an increase in coronavirus infections.
                    <br><br> “There is an urgent need for further investigation of the role children have in the chain of transmission,” write Alyson Kelvin and Scott Halperin, faculty in Dalhousie University’s Department of Pediatrics, in The Lancet
                    Infectious Diseases.</p>
